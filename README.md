# CZI NDCN 2023 Link Tree

Hello!

This is a compendium of resources I explicitly or implicitly described
in my talk at the 2023 CZI NDCN talk.

## CRISPRBrain

Here is the public website for access to CRISPRBrain: https://crisprbrain.org/

## CRISPRBrain API

Here is a direct link to the API for developers: https://crisprbrain.org/api/guide/

## `ggetrs`

Here is a link to a website describing my tool `ggetrs` which I used to perform
an EnrichR analysis directly from the CRISPRBrain API: https://noamteyssier.github.io/ggetrs/

## `sgcount`

Here is a link to a website describing my tool `sgcount` which is used to map
raw fastq files of CRISPRi/a screens to count matrices: https://noamteyssier.github.io/sgcount/ 

## `crispr_screen`

Here is a link to a website describing my tool `crispr_screen` which is used to perform 
the differential abundance testing for sgRNAs and then calculate gene-level enrichments/depletions:
https://noamteyssier.github.io/crispr_screen/

## `howdoi`

If you are just starting with functional genomics screens I'm currently growing a collection of 
tutorials.
These walk you through the steps of performing the bioinformatics analyses yourself from raw fastqs.
